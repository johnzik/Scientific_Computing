This repository contains the solution of an **Ihomogenous Helmoholtz PDE inside an L-Shaped Domain**.

The PDE is solved using various **numerical methods** as a project for the course "Advanced Scientific Calculation" at my university, Democritus University of Thrace.

The methods used are:
  1) LU Decomposition
  2) Conjugate Gradient (CG)
  3) Generalized minimal residual method (GMRes)
  4) Domain Decomposition as a preconditioner (pcd)
  5) A pcd CG
  6) A pcd GMRes
  7) Multigrid as a preconditioner to CG
